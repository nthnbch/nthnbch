Built [QoQa Beta](https://www.qoqa.ch/fr/posts/5369), 800+ testers having fun breaking things.  
Now **Test Manager @ Retraites Populaires** (Lausanne).  

Made [ZenLink](https://github.com/nthnbch/zenlink) to clean messy URLs,  
and [QOTD](https://qotd.ch) for a daily dose of wise quotes.  

Also behind the [Hugo White Paper Theme](https://github.com/nthnbch/hugo-white-paper), simple, clean and Fraktur.
