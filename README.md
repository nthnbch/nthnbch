👋 I'm Nathan!

I am the creator of [QoQa Beta](https://www.qoqa.ch/fr/posts/5369), where I managed a community of 800+ beta testers.

Currently a Test Manager at Retraites Populaires.

I made a small Firefox extension for me: [FFTabClose](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/fftabclose-auto-tab-closer/)  
And a little [macOS app](https://github.com/nthnbch/zenlink) to help keep my URLs less tracked.  

By the way, feel free to check my [Quote Of The Day](https://qotd.ch) website!
